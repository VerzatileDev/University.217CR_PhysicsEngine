# Student-ID-9032499-Pool-Game
3D Physcis Engine Using OpenGl demonstrating the concept of a Pool Game, Which Introduces A Cue Stick Controlled By the user and is Controlled around the cue Ball ( White Ball, used to shoot other balls). The Game Scene should introduce a pool table with 6 pocket holes and colours balls (Striped) and Solid Coloured Balls).  Pool table Should also Introduce Colliders on each end of the Table's Pockets which when impacted (Going into the Hole) Should See if the Correct Ball has entered and decide if or if not the Ball was of the player (As An example A user Hitting in the Final Ball of Black Before all of his Own balls He would lose the game).      Ball Physics : ( NewTonian Principles meaning "Newton Laws" ) When colliding with other object within the Scene : Such as 1. Pockets, 2. Walls, 3. Other balls,         Balls Statistics ( Each Ball Should have its own Values traditionally "It would not Matter as the winner is Whom Ever can shoot all his Balls into the Pocket and then Finish it off with The last Ball of Black) Though Electronically we need to represent  a Scoring method to the User to keep track of how many balls have been hit or scored)
